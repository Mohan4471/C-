 A class has an integer data member 'i' and a function named 'printNum' to print the value of 'i'. Its subclass also has an integer data member 'j' and a function named 'printNum' to print the value of 'j'. Make an object of the subclass and use it to assign a value to 'i' and to 'j'. Now call the function 'printNum' by this object.

 #include <iostream>

class Base {
  public:
    int i;
    void printNum() {
      std::cout << "i = " << i << std::endl;
    }
};

class Sub : public Base {
  public:
    int j;
    void printNum() {
      std::cout << "j = " << j << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  Sub obj;
  obj.i = 5;
  obj.j = 10;
  obj.printNum();
  return 0;
}
